1. Mono-alphabetic Substitution Cipher
Q1: What is a Mono-alphabetic Substitution Cipher?
A: It’s an encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter. The substitution remains constant throughout the message.
Q2: Give an example.
A: If we map A→D, B→E, C→F, then “CAT” becomes “FDW”.
Q3: What is its main weakness?
A: It is vulnerable to frequency analysis because each plaintext letter always maps to the same ciphertext letter.
Q4: What is the key?
A: The key is the substitution mapping between plaintext and ciphertext alphabets.

2. Playfair Cipher (Poly-alphabetic Substitution)
Q1: What is the Playfair Cipher?
A: It is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters (bigrams) using a 5×5 matrix of alphabets.
Q2: How is the key matrix created?
A: A keyword is written first (removing duplicates), followed by the remaining unused letters of the alphabet (I and J are considered the same).
Q3: What happens if both letters are the same?
A: A filler letter (usually ‘X’) is inserted between them.
Q4: What is one limitation of Playfair Cipher?
A: It cannot encrypt a single letter alone; it always works in pairs.
Q5: Example?
A: Key = MONARCHY
Matrix created → Encrypt “BALLOON” as “IBSUPMNR”.

3. Vigenère Cipher
Q1: What is the Vigenère Cipher?
A: It’s a polyalphabetic cipher that uses a keyword to shift each letter of the plaintext by different amounts.
Q2: How does it work?
A: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by the position value of the corresponding letter in the keyword.
Q3: Example?
A: Plaintext = “HELLO”, Key = “KEY” → Ciphertext = “RIJVS”.
Q4: Why is it more secure than Caesar cipher?
A: Because multiple substitution alphabets are used depending on the key letters.

4. Wireshark Filters (Non-Promiscuous Mode)
Q1: What is Wireshark used for?
A: It’s a network packet analyzer used to capture and analyze network traffic.
Q2: What is non-promiscuous mode?
A: In this mode, the network card captures only the packets sent to or from the host machine.
Q3: Give examples of filters.
A:
* ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 → Filter packets for a specific IP

* tcp → Show only TCP packets

* udp → Show only UDP packets

* http → Show only HTTP packets

* icmp → Show only ping packets

Q4: Why use filters?
A: To focus on specific traffic and reduce clutter during analysis.

5. DES Algorithm
Q1: What does DES stand for?
A: Data Encryption Standard.
Q2: What type of cipher is DES?
A: Symmetric block cipher.
Q3: What is the block and key size of DES?
A: 64-bit block size and 56-bit effective key size.
Q4: How many rounds does DES use?
A: 16 rounds of substitution and permutation.
Q5: What is its major drawback?
A: It’s vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to its short key length.

6. SHA-256 Hash Algorithm
Q1: What is SHA-256?
A: It’s a cryptographic hash function from the SHA-2 family that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash.
Q2: Is SHA-256 reversible?
A: No, hash functions are one-way; you can’t retrieve original data from the hash.
Q3: What is a hash used for?
A: To verify data integrity and securely store passwords.
Q4: Example use?
A: Verifying file downloads or blockchain transactions.

7. SHA-512 Hash Algorithm
Q1: What is SHA-512?
A: It’s another member of the SHA-2 family that produces a 512-bit hash output.
Q2: Difference between SHA-256 and SHA-512?
A: The output size (512 bits vs 256 bits) and slightly different internal operations.
Q3: Why use SHA-512?
A: It offers stronger security but is slower and uses more memory.
Q4: Is it still one-way?
A: Yes, like all hash algorithms, it’s irreversible.

8. Snort Security Tool
Q1: What is Snort?
A: It’s an open-source Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS).
Q2: What is it used for?
A: To monitor network traffic and detect suspicious or malicious activity.
Q3: Example commands/logs?
A:
   * snort -v → View captured packets

   * snort -dev → Display packet details

   * snort -c snort.conf → Run Snort with configuration file

   * snort -T -c snort.conf → Test configuration

   * snort -l /log → Log to specified directory

Q4: What type of rules does Snort use?
A: Signature-based rules to detect patterns of known attacks.

9. RSA Algorithm
Q1: What type of encryption is RSA?
A: Asymmetric encryption using two keys – public and private.
Q2: What are the key steps?
A:
      1. Choose two primes (p, q)

      2. Compute n = p × q

      3. Compute φ(n) = (p−1)(q−1)

      4. Choose e such that 1<e<φ(n)

      5. Find d such that e×d ≡ 1 mod φ(n)

Q3: What is public and private key?
A: Public key = (e, n), Private key = (d, n).
Q4: Why is RSA secure?
A: Because factoring large prime numbers is computationally hard.

10. Keylogger Attack
Q1: What is a keylogger?
A: A software or hardware tool that records keystrokes made by a user.
Q2: What is it used for?
A: It can be used for monitoring (legitimate) or malicious data theft (passwords, messages).
Q3: Name one open-source keylogger tool.
A: PyKeylogger, Logkeys, or KidLogger.
Q4: How to prevent keyloggers?
A: Use antivirus, keep software updated, and avoid suspicious downloads.

11. Nmap Tool
Q1: What is Nmap?
A: Network Mapper — an open-source tool used to scan networks and discover hosts/services.
Q2: Common Nmap scan types?
A:
         * Ping Scan → nmap -sn <IP>

         * TCP Scan → nmap -sT <IP>

         * UDP Scan → nmap -sU <IP>

         * OS Detection → nmap -O <IP>

         * Port Range Scan → nmap -p 1-1000 <IP>

Q3: What is the purpose of Nmap?
A: To detect open ports, running services, and security weaknesses.
Q4: Is Nmap legal?
A: Yes, when used for authorized security testing.
